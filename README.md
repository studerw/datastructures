# Data Structures Review

Just some code while reviewing the book  [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 6th Edition by Goodrich, Tamassia, & Goldwasser](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338) to prepare for a upcoming CS class.

There is no main application that is worth running. It is just unit tests.

## Building

`mvn clean package`

## Running Tests

`mvn test`
